class HeteroDataset(InMemoryDataset):
    r"""Heterophilic dataset from the paper 'A critical look at the evaluation of GNNs under 
    heterophily: Are we really making progress?'
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11640>.

    This class represents a collection of heterophilic graph datasets used to evaluate the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in heterophilic settings. These datasets consist of graphs where nodes are connected based on certain relationships, and the task is to classify the nodes based on their features or labels. The datasets in this collection come from different domains, and each dataset has a unique structure and task.

    Dataset Details:

    - **Roman Empire**: A graph from the Wikipedia article on the Roman Empire. Nodes represent words, 
      connected based on their order or syntactic dependencies, with the task to classify words by syntactic roles.
    - **Amazon Ratings**: Based on Amazon co-purchasing data, where nodes are products connected if frequently
      bought together. The task is to predict the product's average rating.
    - **Minesweeper**: A synthetic graph based on Minesweeper. Nodes represent grid cells with edges to neighbors.
      The task is to predict which cells contain mines.
    - **Tolokers**: Represents workers from the Toloka platform, with edges indicating shared tasks. The goal 
      is to predict if a worker was banned.
    - **Questions**: Built from Yandex Q data, with nodes representing users who answered each other's questions 
      on the topic of medicine. The task is to predict if a user remained active.

    Args:
        root (str): Root directory where the dataset should be saved.
        name (str): The name of the dataset to load. Options include:
            - `"roman-empire"`
            - `"amazon-ratings"`
            - `"minesweeper"`
            - `"tolokers"`
            - `"questions"`
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a :obj:`Data` object 
            and returns a transformed version. The data object will be transformed on every access.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        pre_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a :obj:`Data` object 
            and returns a transformed version. The data object will be transformed before being saved to disk.
            (default: :obj:`None`)

    Example:
        >>> dataset = HeteroDataset(root='/path/to/dataset', name='amazon-ratings')
        >>> dataset.data
        >>> dataset[0]  # Accessing the first data point
